# DevOps-test

Complete any two of the following assignments to qualify for an interview. Please share your git repository with code and documentation. Make sure you have run the code on a local or remote (preferably cloud) system. We want to ask you to modify the code during the interview based on a given hypothetical situation. If your code is running on the AWS EKS cluster, it is better to evaluate you. We are looking for a DevOps engineer who has experience on AWS EKS. If you complete all assignments, then that will be a bonus. 

Please don't spend more than 30-60 mins on any of the following assignments. Feel free to submit an incomplete code. Every line of code helps us to understand your strength. Show your strength ðŸ’ª.
