# DevOps-test

Complete any two of the following assignments to qualify for an interview. Please share your git repository with code and documentation. Make sure you have run the code on a local or remote (preferably cloud) system. During the interview, we would like to ask to modify the code based on a given hypothetical situation. If your code is running on the AWS EKS cluster, then it is better for us to evaluate you. We are looking for a DevOps engineer who has experience on AWS EKS. If you complete all assignments, then that will be a bonus. 

### Kubernetes:

Write a helm chart or Kubernetes code to deploy WordPress based website. 

### Terraform:

Write a Terraform code to provision EKS cluster with AWS Load Balancer Controller or ingress controllers.

### CI/CD:

Write a simple CI/CD pipeline for Springboot or NodeJS application on gitlab.com or github.com.

### Build System:

Write a docker file to build any Springboot or NodeJS application. Improve the build speed by using multistage build. Provide better solutions/ tools to improve build time like Maven, Gradle, Skaffold, kaniko, Buildpacks. 

PS: If you reuse code from any source, then mention the original source.
